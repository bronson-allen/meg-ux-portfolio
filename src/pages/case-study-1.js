        <p>
          Keys to Success is an education-based app that helps high school
          students and adults navigate their way towards higher education. On
          the app users can discover career options, track progress in classes
          they are currently enrolled in, learn new skills, and even apply for
          scholarships all while earning points to spend on gift cards to local
          restaurants.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The Keys to Success admin users of the application had an admin
          login/tool that was operating like a website instead of a control
          panel. When a user logged into the application, the first screen they
          would see is the Users screen. While this is a screen that is used
          often, there were better uses for such key real estate of the first
          screen a user sees. The admin users realized there were some features
          that users chose most often, but some of those features were buried
          within the application.

        <p>
          Turn the first screen seen on application into a control center with a
          dashboard. Include a quick access version of the requested and
          most-used features on the dashboard. Move the navigation from the top
          to a sidebar on the left that expanded and collapsed. Create a design
          system and updated the overall UI of the application while using the
          new navigation and dashboard as a starting point.

        <h3>PHASE 1</h3>
        <p>
          When I started on the project, the application had outdated UI and was
          functioning like a typical website instead of a place where
          adminstrative tasks are handeled. While talk of updating the UI was in
          the works, it wasn’t in the budget for the year. Because of this, I
          created a homepage on their current app that included widgets for
          their most-used features at the time. I worked with the program
          manager and other employees on the KTS team to figure out what
          features on the app were used the most and could have a “snapshot”
          version displayed on this new screen. The page continued the style
          that the application currently had. These widgets gave an overview of
          the feature and would take them to the original page with the full
          details when clicked on. The homepage was adjusted for users with less
          access than the main super admin users by removing the features they
          didn’t have access to.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="column-cs">
        <h3>PHASE 2</h3>
        <p>
          The next year, the client was convinced that a UI refresh was
          desparately needed. I was able to take what I had made on the
          dashboard I had created previously and use it as a starting point for
          what was now going to be their dashboard screen. This would be the
          first screen they saw when they logged in. I also switched the
          navigation from the top to a panel on the left that expanded and
          collapsed to have more screen space available. Along with these
          changes came the overall UI update for the entire application. To
          start this I created a simple design system including font styles,
          buttons styles, form styles and other componenets based on their
          current brand guidelines. This design system was implemented to the
          new naviIgation and dashboard first, then the rest of the application
          after that.{" "}

          The first version of this dashboard was the homepage using the old
          design of the app. While desigining this, I knew there was so much
          potential to make this dashboard feature incredibly useful while also
          looking current. I kept ideas I had for this screen for a potential UI
          make-over that I hoped was in the near future. I even built a version
          that had a slightly updated design to encourage them to do the UI
          updates. While the client loved what could be done in the future with
          the updated version, they were still very excited for this “homepage”
          feature to be implemented on the current app because it was going to
          be a huge time saver for them.

        <p>
          This dashboard includes a way to see if any announcements are
          currently live on the admin app (and quick access to add one),
          stastics on how many approvals are needed, information about the
          current Master Key feature, alerts, numbers for scholarship
          applications, quick links, and quick exports.

        <p>
          When the budget for the app UI refresh was approved, I had a great
          starting point with my original design. Some time passed since I made
          that version, so I started doing research on the most current
          dashboard experiences and styles. While a lot of the UX was remaining
          the same, I had the chance to start totally from scratch (while still
          keeping branding colors and fonts) with the UI. Along with the overall
          UI update, I moved the navigation from lining the top to a sidebar
          menu on the left that identifies sections by icons and has subsections
          shown in a popout when clicked on. This allowed more screen space to
          be used throughout all of the app.{" "}

          <p>
            I created a simple design system that included colors, typography,
            button styles, form fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, toggles, and
            some icons. The brand already had a color palete and font selected,
            so I applied those into the system. I was first focused on the
            homepage-turned-dashboard first, but I kept in mind the rest of the
            app as I created the system. I had worked on the app for a long
            enough time that I knew what would and wouldn’t work within a
            system. And the rest of the app was also getting the facelift, but
            none of the UX would be changing at this time.

            The final design enhanced the experience of what had already been
            created and had a very impactful update to the UI. The new look and
            feel has a much brighter presence which encourages a more positive
            attitude when users log into the app. I was able to correct some
            flaws I found in my original design, mainly condensing sections by
            adding a scroll and using the brand colors to give each feature on
            the screen their individual identifiers. One of my favorite updates
            was changing the tab design that was present in mutliple feature
            sections on the dashboard. I placed them all on one line with a
            highlight bar below the selected item. This not only saved space,
            but was also used throughout the rest of the app on internal pages.{" "}

        <p>
          The client was so excited for the dashboard feature to exist on the
          old version of the app. It achieved their goal of having a one-stop
          place where they could get a quick overview of some of their most-used
          features. The final version with the new UI blew them away. The
          dashboard that showcased the new design system got them excited for
          the rest of the application to get the UI makeover and solidified
          their decision that they made the right choice to move forward with
          this project. As the new internal screens were presented to the
          client, they were inspired to add even more features to the app to
          make the experience better for them as the “super admins” and the
          other users of the application.

        <p>
          Having the opportunity to create a solution to the problem and then,
          later, make it EVER BETTER was a great learning opportunity. The two
          designs showcase how much I improved as a designer in the eight months
          between both of these projects. Getting the chance to take a long step
          back and then re-address the problems gave me even more insight than I
          would have gotten on another type of project. Looking back, I think
          that I could have made the original version of the dashboard have more
          specific and interesting UI, but part of my tactic was to show how it
          could be so much better if they went through with the UI redo, so it
          worked out in the end. I also learned how much branding affects how I
          design. It was less challengeing the second time around when the
          overall look and feel of the site was more modern and less
          restrictive.{" "}
