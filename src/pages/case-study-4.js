        <p>
          Success in Education is a company that provides education based
          programs for students in K-12 and beyond by working with local
          schools. They reward the teachers and staff who help facilitate the
          program at the end of every school year. This is done by visiting
          every school that is participating (up to 100 schools) and delivering
          coupons to in person. This takes a lot of time for the Success in
          Education program managers, so they wanted an easier way to get the
          coupons to the teacher and staff every year. This project had very,
          very quick timeline as they needed it to be live before the end of a
          school year and we started it a few months before that.

          <p>
            First, I decided on the overall structure of the site. Once this was
            confirmed, I focused on the main experience on this website: viewing
            and redeeming coupons. I used the paper coupon book the client was
            already using as inspiration for the digitized version. I created
            coupon templates that allowed every different type of coupon to fit
            into, including higher tiered sponsors who would get extra space for
            their items on the screen. After that, I researched and laid out all
            the different scenarios for redeeming the different coupons and put
            every coupon for the year in one of the categories. I, then, worked
            on how the experience would differ for each of the scenarios. After
            that I worked through the rest of the site: sign up, login, my
            account, about, sponsors, help center, emails.

        <p>
          The wireframes were created and prototyped to ensure a positive
          experience before moving onto the high-fidelity mockups. The
          wireframes were designed in a mobile first strategy because the
          majority of the coupons were to be redeemed in person while people are
          out of their homes. (Desktop wireframes were made as well.) The layout
          for the coupons was one of the most challenging but exiting and fun
          screens to work on based on the requirements. The wireframes were
          shown to the client before moving onto the next steps.

        <h2 className="color-primary-dark">DESIGN CHANGES</h2>
        <p>
          After reviewing the wireframes with the client, we got more
          information about the coupon redemption process. Due to time and
          budget constraints, we learned that some of the coupon experiences
          would need to rely on the honor system with the users so that they
          were not used more than once. As a team, we were able to adjust the
          experience for the coupons so that it wouldnâ€™t be possible to use them
          twice (for some of the redemption scenarios). This was approved by the
          client and implented in the final designs. We also got more direction
          on what was necessary for the coupon hierarchy and worked with the
          client on creating a tier system to organize the main coupon screen in
          a way that would honor the biggest sponsors for the program. It was
          also in this stage that a need for a redeemed and non-redeemed version
          of the coupon screens was confirmed.

            New brand colors and fonts had just been approved for the Success in
            Education brand as the start of a process to unify all of their

          <p>
            The final design gave users a streamlined process that can be access
            anytime from a mobile or desktop device. The users are able to look
            through all of the coupons, see the directions for redeeming each
            coupon and know if they have already redeemed a coupon or not. The
            site had a login that was attached to their logins for the Success
            in Education programs themselves, so if they are able to log in to
            their program account, theyâ€™re able to log in into this account as
            well. The final design included email templates for the admins to
            send out at the end of every school year when the coupons get
            refreshed.

            The coupons page of this website is where most actionable items take
            place. All available coupons for the year are seen here. I designed
            four different dimensions for the coupons. This is so that there is
            an option to fit the title, logo and other copy in whatever way
            necessary. These sizes are also able to fit in different patterns to
            fill necesary space. When the coupons are refreshed each year, they
            will all have a spot they can fit in. Per the clientâ€™s request,
            there are two tiers of coupns. This is to highlight their larger
            sponsors. There is also a way to toggle between all coupons,
            available coupons, and coupons that have already been redeemed. A
            help center, about information page, and account information page
            are also available on the site at easy access in the main
            navigation.

            There are two different ways to redeem coupons based on what the
            sponsoring companies are able to provide to the Keys to Success
            team. This is to accomadate the wide range of ages of
            teachers/admins in the school system because there are varying
            levels of comfortability with technology. Route number one is for
            the user to self-identify if they have redeemed their coupon. The
            other route is that the the sponsor provides a one-time use bar
            code. This bar code can be used at any participating location. This
            is the route that the client wants the sponsors to go so it was
            focused on a bit more. I am showing the mobile view here because the
            assumption for the personas we have is that they will redeem these
            on the spot on their phone. There are printable options as well in
            the desktop view.

          The client was thrilled to be able to send an email to participating
          teachers and staff every year and not have to take the time to visit
          all of the schools throughout the state. The users of the digital
          coupon book appreciated that they had a space to always access their
          coupons and it wasnâ€™t something they could physically lose anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prouct was so successful, the client hopes to integrate it into an
          admin tool that was built for them in the past so they can manage more
          of the updates on their end.

        <h2 className="color-primary-dark">WHAT I LEARNED</h2>
        <p>
          During this project I learned the importance of designing mobile first
          for the sake of quick development. This approach forced me to focus on
          what was actually necessary for users to see and helped developers
          build the product very quickly, which was necessary given the super
          quick turnaround time that was needed. It was also a good reminder
          that simplicity on mobile screens is totally okay in some situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project also showed me the benefit of using slightly more high
          fidelity wireframes because the transition from wireframes to the
          final design was very quick. Almost all of the client feedback came to
          us during the wireframe stage, which meant that when the final design
          approval process came, there was very little to change. This, again,
          kept the work for the project constant on the develpment side, which
          my internal team needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, there was not time to test this product before going
          live. At the time of launch, the plan was to gather user data and get
          feedback from actual users and make improvements before the coupons
          were launched again for the next school year.
