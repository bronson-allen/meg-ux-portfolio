The release date of this tool was aligned with a statewide\r\n          initiative that all high schools participated in called “Utah College\r\n          Application Week” so that students would have a guide they can use on\r\n          their own in addition to their college counselors at school.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h3>ROLE</h3>\r\n        <p>Lead Experience Designer</p>\r\n        <h3>COLLABORATIONS</h3>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Development Team, Project Manager, Account Director from Hoverstate,\r\n          Program Manager from Keys to Success team, Utah System of Higher\r\n          Education Team\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n        <img className=\"resize-md\" src={iPhoneImage} />\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <hr />\r\n    <div className=\"row-cs\">\r\n      <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n        <img className=\"resize-md\" src={USHELogo} />\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n        <h2 className=\"color-primary-dark\">PROBLEM</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Keys to Success is an education-based app that helps high school\r\n          students and adults navigate their way towards higher education.

The Keys to Success team wanted a redesign of a\r\n          feature that had been created the year before as a way to help guide\r\n          students along the college application process. The goal was that this\r\n          feature would be especially helpful during the already existing\r\n          College Application Week. The client and the USHE team needed several\r\n          additions to the current feature to be a highly used feature on the\r\n          application and to get extra emphasis during the actual college\r\n          application week.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <hr />\r\n    <div className=\"row-cs\">\r\n      <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n        <h2 className=\"color-primary-dark\">SOLUTION</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Create a checklist of steps that are needed to learn about in-state\r\n          universities, complete an application, apply for financial aid, and\r\n          find scholarships.

After gaining knowlege in those areas I had interview\r\n          style meetings with the key stakeholders including members of the Utah\r\n          System of Higher Education organiIzation, the client, and my internal\r\n          team. We were able to get some great insight from others at my company\r\n          who had gone through the college application process in recent years.\r\n          These conversations lead us to come up with the firts draft of the\r\n          checklist items we would need to include.\r\n        </p>\r\n        {\"\\n\"}\r\n        <h3>PHASE 2: RECYCLING THE CURRENT FEATURE</h3>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Before diving into the wireframes and high fidelity designs I did an\r\n          in-depth inventory on what the feature currently provided.

(Ex. A list of all in-state schools already existed\r\n          so I was able to reuse that screen, but how to select a school was\r\n          altered to fit the new experience.)\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n        <img style={styles.portrait} src={cs2ProcessDiagram} />\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <hr />\r\n    <div className=\"row-cs\">\r\n      <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n        <h2 className=\"color-primary-dark\">PERSONAS</h2>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div className=\"row-cs align-start\">\r\n      <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n        <img style={styles.icon} src={iconPersona} />\r\n        <h3>PERSONA 1</h3>\r\n        <h4 className=\"secondary-color\">The Power User</h4>\r\n        <p>\r\n          A 12th grade student (in their last year of high school) who is a new\r\n          or current user of the application.

I explored the idea of having one checklist\r\n          per school, but based on the research I had done on lists this wasn’t\r\n          as intuitive for the user. I ended up going with a flow that allowed\r\n          the user to tap on the checklist item and go into a details screen for\r\n          lists items that involved more than one task (because of multiple\r\n          school selection).\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          I originally had the various resources/links that needed to be\r\n          included on the feature spread throughout the list items. But I ended\r\n          up grouping the checklist into sections. I made the in-app resources\r\n          to one location below the checklist which created more a space for\r\n          users to know what they could do within in the app that related to the\r\n          College Application Checklist.{\" \"}\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <hr />\r\n    <div className=\"row-cs\">\r\n      <div className=\"row-cs\">\r\n        <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n          <h2 className=\"color-primary-dark\">DESIGN SYSTEM</h2>\r\n          <p>\r\n            A Keys to Success design system that included colors, fonts,\r\n            buttons, components and icons was already in place for this\r\n            application so, I was able to follow it for this new feature. I\r\n            added elements to the system as designing where necessary.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row-cs align-start\">\r\n        <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n          <img style={styles.portrait} src={cs2DesignSystemColors} />\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n          <img style={styles.portrait} src={cs2DesignSystemText} />\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row-cs align-start\">\r\n        <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n          <img style={styles.portrait} src={cs2DesignSystemButtons} />\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n          <img style={styles.portrait} src={cs2DesignSystemComponents} />\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <hr />\r\n    <div className=\"row-cs\">\r\n      <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n        <h2 className=\"color-primary-dark\">FINAL DESIGN</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          The final design was an in-depth feature that helped connect the app’s\r\n          different parts. The feature included and itemized list of the steps\r\n          necessary to prepare for college, an interactive map to locate\r\n          institutions in the state, links to federal and state resources all\r\n          while allowing students to earn points while completing specific tasks\r\n          (a motivating aspect for users that is used throughout the whole app.\r\n          Originally, the checkmarks did not all get checked off in the same way\r\n          (some were automatic based on the user’s actions), but in the end I\r\n          gave all of them the same experiIence, which is that they mark the\r\n          task done themselves. If there is more than one item/school listed for\r\n          the task, the main checklist item only checks off all after all\r\n          checkboxes on the details screen have been marked as completed by the\r\n          user. This was decided because while some items had the capabiliIty to\r\n          automatically be checked off based on taps from the user, some needed\r\n          to be self marked.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          The already existing screens were enhanced to create a more seemless\r\n          and connected experience. Most notable is the interactive map screen\r\n          that is powered by Google Maps. Users are now able to “select a\r\n          school” when they tap on the location icon for the school, whereas\r\n          before, they had to click on the details to add the school or add\r\n          directly from the list view. The map screen also got a toggle at the\r\n          top to go back and forth between the map view and list view. Users are\r\n          also able to see the distance to a school based on their zip code.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n        <img style={styles.portrait} src={cs2FinalDesign1} />\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div className=\"row-cs\">\r\n      <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n        <img style={styles.portrait} src={cs2FinalDesign2} />\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n        <p>\r\n          The feature got a well earned access point on the home screen of the\r\n          app and at the time it was finished, the goal was that it will\r\n          eventually become one of the most used features on the application\r\n          itself.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          {\" \"}\r\n          If users completed the entire checklist, they are rewarded 25 points.\r\n          This corresponds with the point system that already existed on the\r\n          app. Users earn points all throughout the app for completing tasks\r\n          like applying for a scholarship, taking a career apptitude test, etc.\r\n          These points can then be redeemed for prizes (Ex. fast food giftcards,\r\n          free items as local businesses). Users are notified that this feature\r\n          earns them points through the announcement modal that is sent during\r\n          Utah College Application Week to teach them about the feature itself.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h3>PAIN POINTS</h3>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Unfortunately, time was not included for usability testing on this\r\n          project. I worked with the internal data science team on where to\r\n          track user behavior so that the feature can be enhanced by the next\r\n          “Utah College Application” week which would be the following year. The\r\n          statstics of the users actions are shown below.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <hr />\r\n    <div className=\"row-cs\">\r\n      <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n        <h2 className=\"color-primary-dark\">PRODUCT SUCCESSES</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          The team was able to get this feature out in a very short time. The\r\n          designs went through many iterations in the wireframe/low fidelity\r\n          phase because of the multitude of routes to take with the list itself.\r\n          The feature is an excellent resource for students who want to learn\r\n          more about colleges within their state. It can be a place to track\r\n          progress if they chose to start the application with any schools they\r\n          are interested in. School counselors are able to utltlize this feature\r\n          when working with students who are wanting to apply to college. Users\r\n          are able to do things at their own pace and be rewarded for their hard\r\n          work as they go, while always having a reference point when talking to\r\n          school counselors, teachers, and parents.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          The feature also includes multiple outside resources that students may\r\n          not have learned about otherwise. Many of these resources fulfill the\r\n          goals of the Utah Systems of Higher Education, who were involved with\r\n          this effort.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n        <img style={styles.portrait} src={cs2SuccessMetric1} />\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div className=\"row-cs reverse\">\r\n      <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n        <img style={styles.portrait} src={cs2SuccessMetric3} />\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n        <p style={{ fontWeight: \"bold\" }}>\r\n          Other things to take into consideration when analyzing the data are:\r\n        </p>\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>\r\n            Did schools/districts tell students to use the app during College\r\n            Application Week\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            How many users applied for schools via the information from the app,\r\n            but did not “self-declare” that they applied\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>\r\n            Did users who used the College Application Week feature already have\r\n            an active account/familiarity with the app or were they new users\r\n          </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <p>\r\n          This data along with information from the Keys to Success and Utah\r\n          System of Higher Education teams helped us decide on a plan to improve\r\n          the feature before the 2023 College Application Week.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <hr />\r\n    <div className=\"row-cs\">\r\n      <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n        <h2 className=\"color-primary-dark\">WHAT I LEARNED</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          During this project I learned how to take a stressful and very large\r\n          task many people have to deal with at some point in their life and\r\n          narrow it down into reasonable pieces. I liked that this feature was\r\n          geared to be a one-stop shop for students living in Utah who may not\r\n          have parents or family members who have gone through the application\r\n          process before. I was able to balance creating instructions within the\r\n          feature, with pulling outside resources that already existed.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Because there were many stakeholders from various organizations in\r\n          this project, I learned how to strategize my designs based on many\r\n          opinions (that didn’t always align). I was able to use my expertise in\r\n          areas of design in a new way when presenting designs to large crowds\r\n          with various goals associated within the groups. This project also\r\n          helped me solidify my love for mobile design. Being constrained to a\r\n          smaller rectangle of space is a challenge I am always eager to accept.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <ScrollToTop showBelow={250} />\r\n  </Layout>\r\n)\r\n\r\nconst styles = {\r\n  row: {\r\n    display: \"flex\",\r\n    flexDirection: \"row\",\r\n    flexWrap: \"wrap\",\r\n    width: \"100%\",\r\n  },\r\n  column: {\r\n    padding: ` 0 var(--space-5)`,\r\n    display: \"flex\",\r\n    flexDirection: \"column\",\r\n    flexBasis: \"100%\",\r\n    flex: 1,\r\n  },\r\n  textContainer: {\r\n    display: \"flex\",\r\n    flexDirection: \"column\",\r\n  },\r\n  portrait: {\r\n    // display: \"flex\",\r\n    maxWidth: \"100%\",\r\n    // alignSelf: \"center\",\r\n    //TODO: styling for images of different sizes and centering\r\n  },\r\n  icon: {\r\n    maxWidth: \"42px\",\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport const Head = () => <Seo title=\"Case Study 2\" />\r\n\r\nexport default CaseStudyTwo\r\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/iPhone1-d65960554618843af30db2bd4602944c.png\";","export default \"data:image/png;base64,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\""],"names":["styles","buttonText","display","color","justifyContent","alignItems","fontWeight","fontSize","icon","maxHeight","margin","className","style","onClick","window","scrollTo","top","behavior","src","row","flexDirection","flexWrap","width","column","padding","flexBasis","flex","textContainer","portrait","maxWidth","Head","title","iPhoneImage","USHELogo","cs2ProcessDiagram","iconPersona","cs2Wireframe","cs2DesignChanges","cs2DesignSystemColors","cs2DesignSystemText","cs2DesignSystemButtons","cs2DesignSystemComponents","cs2FinalDesign1","cs2FinalDesign2","cs2SuccessMetric1","cs2SuccessMetric3","ScrollToTop","showBelow"],"sourceRoot":""}
