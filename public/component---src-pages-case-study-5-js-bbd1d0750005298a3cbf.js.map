I also started having problems with using buttons on the bottom right of the screen leading users through the entire process. Because of this, I changed the progress bar experience to now be a side navigation system. This would allow users to access all areas of the house in one glance, and because this is only used on iPad, we had the space for it to always be expanded.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row-cs\">\r\n        <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n          <h3 >USER TESTING</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The feedback from the first round of user testing was very positive. Users really liked the side navigation as it was familiar to them from the current competitor app they were using. There was confusion about the new process of adding all areas and THEN inspecting all items, which was expected. We planned for this to be addressed by project supervisors and in training for the new tool. Overall, users were able to get through the wireframes easily and liked the direction the feature was taking.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n        <img style={styles.portrait} src={cs5designChanges} />\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <hr />\r\n    <div className=\"row-cs\">\r\n      <div className=\"row-cs\">\r\n        <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n          <h2 className=\"color-primary-dark\">DESIGN SYSTEM</h2>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Phase 1 of a new companywide design system had just been launched as I was starting on this project. The mobile version of the design system has not yet been released, so I stuck to the desktop version everywhere I could and had permission to adjust things to mobile as needed. See some of what the in-depth design system included below.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row-cs\">\r\n        <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n          <img style={styles.portrait} src={cs5designSystem1} />\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row-cs\">\r\n        <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n          <img style={styles.portrait} src={cs5designSystem2} />\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <hr />\r\n    <div className=\"row-cs\">\r\n      <div className=\"row-cs\">\r\n        <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n          <h2 className=\"color-primary-dark\">FINAL DESIGN</h2>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Before my next round of testing I implemented updated stakeholder requirements and applied the design system to all of the designs. The stakeholders wanted an experience in which the most used areas on properties were pre-populated on the left navigation and users then had the ability to delete an area if the property they were scoping did not have that area. (There was still a way to add a new area and custom area if needed.) After many attempts of keeping the UI the same with these new requirements, I ended up adding an indicator under each area name that tells the user that there are required fields that are empty on this area. When all the required fields are filled out, the indicator is removed (or if the area is deleted).\r\n\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            There were also consistent changes to the requirements for when an inspected item was marked as “needs work,” so I kept iterating those screens due to changing opinions from different areas of the business.\r\n\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row-cs\">\r\n        <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n          <h3>USER TESTING</h3>\r\n          <p>\r\n            I tested with real users again (some the same as the first test; others were new). All of the users were really receptive to the side navigation as it was similar to what they currently use. There was some confusion on what certain fields were on the “need work” flow, but this was something being added to their workload, so again, it will be explained more in depth with the training that comes with the launch of this feature. I got feedback that users wanted more of an indicator to know when an area has all items inspected and required fields completed, so I updated the UI to make that more obvious. I also got feedback that users wanted to tap “save” on screens where they don’t actually need to save anything because the contents are auto-saving. For this I updated copy in the instruction text for adding areas and we have a plan to add some onboarding onto the tool for the first time they use it in the feature if we hear this as consistent feedback. Lastly, I learned that users wanted the ability to take more than one photo at a time in any photo scenario throughout the tool. I worked with the PM and the developers to resolve this.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            After implementing feedback from the user test, I added the following features to finish off the high fidelity designs:\r\n          </p>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>A notes section that is accessible in the left navigation throughout the entire process where users can leave internal or client facing notes</li>\r\n            <li>Full add photo from device flow</li>\r\n            <li>Full take photo flow</li>\r\n            <li>Photo markup capabilities</li>\r\n            <li>A more robust “N/A” selection process for the item inspections</li>\r\n            <li>A progress bar for the scope submission process (due to dev feedback)</li>\r\n            <li>Error states</li>\r\n            <li>All confirm cancellation or deletion modals</li>\r\n            <li>Save & exit option</li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"row-cs\">\r\n\r\n        <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n          <Cs5VideoComponent />\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <hr />\r\n\r\n    <div className=\"row-cs\">\r\n      <div className=\"column-cs\">\r\n        <h2 className=\"color-primary-dark\">WHAT I LEARNED</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Sometimes you don’t need to re-invent the wheel entirely. Going into this I really wanted to do something different with the UX/UI than what our main competitor was doing. Once I tested out the wireframes, I quickly learned that some of what the competitor had was well thought out and made sense in the specific scenario I was designing for. My user testing confirmed that keeping a similar design was what the right experience to include.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          This project was also a great experience for me to embrace the process of iterating. The “Needs work” section saw a lot of iterations through the design process and post launch, and I learned to go along with all the changes while pushing back when necessary.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <ScrollToTop showBelow={250} />\r\n  </Layout >\r\n)\r\n\r\nconst styles = {\r\n  row: {\r\n    display: \"flex\",\r\n    flexDirection: \"row\",\r\n    flexWrap: \"wrap\",\r\n    width: \"100%\",\r\n  },\r\n  column: {\r\n    padding: ` 0 var(--space-5)`,\r\n    display: \"flex\",\r\n    flexDirection: \"column\",\r\n    flexBasis: \"100%\",\r\n    flex: 1,\r\n  },\r\n  textContainer: {\r\n    display: \"flex\",\r\n    flexDirection: \"column\",\r\n  },\r\n  portrait: {\r\n    maxWidth: \"100%\",\r\n  },\r\n  imgWide: {\r\n    width: \"100%\",\r\n  },\r\n  wireframeMobile: {\r\n    maxWidth: \"50%\",\r\n    maxHeight: \"95%\",\r\n  },\r\n  icon: {\r\n    maxWidth: \"42px\",\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport const Head = () => <Seo title=\"Case Study 4\" />\r\n\r\nexport default CaseStudyOne\r\n"],"names":["styles","buttonText","display","color","justifyContent","alignItems","fontWeight","fontSize","icon","maxHeight","margin","className","style","onClick","window","scrollTo","top","behavior","src","Cs5VideoComponent","render","autoPlay","width","height","preload","finalDesignScopeTool","type","React","row","flexDirection","flexWrap","column","padding","flexBasis","flex","textContainer","portrait","maxWidth","imgWide","wireframeMobile","Head","title","cs5keyboardTypingStock","cs5currentScopingFlow","cs5newScopingFlow","cs5wireframe","cs5designChanges","cs5designSystem1","cs5designSystem2","ScrollToTop","showBelow"],"sourceRoot":""}
